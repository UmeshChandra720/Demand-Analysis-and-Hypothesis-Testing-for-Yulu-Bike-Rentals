# Demand-Analysis-and-Hypothesis-Testing-for-Yulu-Bike-Rentals
This project analyzes over 10,000+ bike rental records to understand the impact of weather, season, and working days on rental demand.   It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-Square), and Business Recommendations.

Yulu Bike Rental Demand Analysis
📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes rental data from Yulu's electric bikes to identify key factors influencing rental demand. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square), the project provides actionable business recommendations to optimize fleet management based on seasonal and weather patterns.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook

Data Visualization

Hypothesis Testing (t-test, ANOVA, Chi-Square Test)

🔍 Project Steps
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled data types, missing values, and performed initial exploration.

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Visualized distributions and relationships across variables using histograms, boxplots, and countplots.

Hypothesis Testing:

2-Sample T-Test to check if working days impact rental counts.

ANOVA to examine rental differences across seasons and weather conditions.

Chi-square test to test dependency between weather and seasons.

Insights Generation: Identified strong seasonal and weather influences on rental patterns.

Recommendations: Strategic fleet allocation based on demand trends and predictive weather patterns.

📈 Key Insights
Rental demand significantly increases during summer and fall seasons.

Clear and moderately cloudy weather conditions encourage higher bike rentals.

Working days see statistically different rental counts compared to non-working days.

Weather conditions are strongly dependent on seasons.

💡 Recommendations
Fleet Adjustment: Increase bike availability during peak seasons (Summer and Fall).

Weather-Based Planning: Plan maintenance and fleet deployment based on weather forecasts.

Promotional Offers: Launch discount campaigns during off-peak seasons (Spring, Winter).

Metro/Office Zones: Strengthen bike availability near high-traffic areas during weekdays.
